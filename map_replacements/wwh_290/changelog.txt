Notes:
Note this heist was edited without consideration for lower difficulty adjustment.

Note that immediately prior to launch, an irregularity in asset extraction caused a crash on load. We had to remove a debris decal from the art1 continent; We have recorded its locations and will restore it in a later patch if it becomes possible and if time permits.
